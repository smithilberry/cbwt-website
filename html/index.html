            <h5>What is CBWT?</h5>
            <p>
              CampBikeWineTour, or CBWT, is an annual trip to Himrod, New York where a group of
              friends (and strangers!) embark on a weekend of camping, biking and wine tasting
              around the beautiful Seneca Lake
            </p>
            <h5>When is it?</h5>
            <p>
              Every year during the first weekend in August. The trip is centered around the Garlic
              Festival at Fox Run Vineyards, so the dates always change. The trip usually runs from
              a Thursday to Monday but the important day is Saturday, the wine tasting and biking
              day
            </p>
            <h5>Where is it?</h5>
            <p class="map">
              We travel to the beautiful Seneca Lake in upstate New York. Seneca Lake is part of the
              Finger Lakes, a series of lakes parallel to each other that form the shape of a hand.
              The bike tour starts at
              <a href="http://www.foxrunvineyards.com/" target="_blank">Fox Run Vineyards</a> and
              ends at <a href="http://mileswinecellars.com/" target="_blank">Miles Wine Cellars</a>
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- ACTIVITIES -->
          <div class="section-content">
            <h2 id="activities">Tour Activities</h2>
            <h5>The Camp Sites</h5>
            <p>
              We usually rent out a few sites depending on the amount of attendees, but each
              individual camp site comes with a picnic table and a tire rim for burning wood. The
              grounds themselves provide wood and ice for a small fee as well as showers and
              restrooms that are cleaned daily. There is ample tree canopies for shade and the sites
              sit only a moment from the lake
            </p>
            <h5>Seneca Lake</h5>
            <p>
              The lake rests at the bottom of the camp sites and gives unfettered access to the 37
              mile long lake. Because the lake is so large we dont suggest straying too far from the
              shore as you may not recognize the camp from far away. There are kayaks to rent for an
              additional fee, and there are some boat rentals facilities further away that have
              full-day and half-day rental service
            </p>
            <h5>Biking</h5>
            <p>
              While the biking day is saturday, please feel free to ride your bike whenever you
              please, although the camp is at the bottom of a steep hill (The bikes are brought to
              the furthest point via vehicle on bike day). The roads are mostly straight with a
              variety of inclines and declines. The roads are not heavily trafficed but do be safe
              and aware of your surroundings
            </p>
            <h5>Wine Tasting (and one brewery)</h5>
            <p>
              The road on which the camp sites sit have numerous amounts of wineries spaced out
              along the way. Some are a few miles apart and others just a short ride. During the
              biking tour we stop at most wineries and partake in wine tasting as a group though
              sometimes the group is staggered. The price varies but the average is about $4 per
              tasting which usually comes with about 5-6 wines to taste. Feel free to buy bottles of
              wine along the way. Some people bring backpacks hold additional bottles along the ride
            </p>
            <h5>The Garlic Festival</h5>
            <p>
              The Garlic Festival is the final large activity of the weekend, it is also how the
              trip is annually scheduled. For us, it begins Sunday afternoon where traditionally
              those that are leaving for the weekend finally dispatch after having one final
              celebratory group outing. The festival has free entrance and takes place at the
              initial winery that we visit on Saturday, Fox Run Vineyards. It houses dozens of
              vendors, food tents and live music. Of course, if you still want some wine, the winery
              itself is open that day as well
            </p>

            <h5>Physical Risks</h5>
            <p>
              The tour takes place at the start of the typically hottest month of the year, so
              prepare for heat and sweat. The biking tour can be greuling on the body, especially
              when using a bicycle that is not well fitted for your body, so keep in mind any
              physical limitations. Heat and physical stress mixed with alcohol consumption can be
              dangerous, SO PACE YOURSELF. CBWT is not a competition - there is no winner's medal
            </p>
            <h5>Drug / Alcohol / Condition Interactions</h5>
            <p>
              You could ingest an amount of alcohol that can interact with your medications and / or
              physical conditions. If you are unsure about the impact of the factors speak with your
              doctor for any further recommendations
